# Bomberman-Game-In-CPP-Using-OpenGL
This project is about implementing various aspects of the classic 2D Bomberman game in C++, using object oriented principles.

**OpenGL** was used for graphics.

A **skeleton** code was provided by our teacher, which initialized the graphics of the board and characters. Our task was to make changes/additions to this code.

Currently, the bomberpacman is able to move in a relatively smooth fashion and there is edge/obstacle detection to some extent, although not perfect. Collision with the ghost also results in a game over. And the level resets to a random new layout. 

Bomb placement also works, and is centered. After a few seconds, it explodes, resulting in nearby destructable blocks and/or ghosts to be destroyed. Ofcourse, the player can die aswell.
